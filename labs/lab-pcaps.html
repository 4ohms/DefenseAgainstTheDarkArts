<h1>COMP 116: Introduction to Computer Security</h1>
<h2>Lab: Packet Sleuth</h2>
<h2>Due: Tuesday, February 6th</h2>

<p class="note">This lab is worth 20 points.  You must complete this lab individiually, on your own.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Learn how to <span class="stress">read</span> and <span class="stress">dissect</span> files and sensitive information (including usernames and passwords) from packet sets using open source tools</li>
	<li>Work with real network traffic from arguably the world's most dangerous computer network</li>
	<li>Understand the dangers of sending data over an open network unencrypted, "in-the-clear"</li>
	<li>Learn and utilize encoding schemes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>You are given three sets of packet captures from three different networks in PCAP format to analyze: one from a network where file transfers occurred, one from a university network, and one from arguably the world's most hostile network, DEF CON in Las Vegas, NV.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Download the following PCAP files inside of your Kali Linux virtual machine:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set 1: <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/set1.pcap" target="_blank">http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/set1.pcap</a> (208 KB)</li>
<li>Set 2: <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/set2.pcap" target="_blank">http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/set2.pcap</a> (64 MB. <span class="note">NOTE: I am not responsible for the contents in this PCAP.</span>)</li>
<li>Set 3: <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/set3.pcap" target="_blank">http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/set3.pcap</a> (17 KB)</li>
</ol>

<p>Open and analyze the sets of data, one at a time, using <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/" target="_blank">Wireshark</a>.  It is highly recommended that you also use additional open source tools (e.g., <a href="http://ettercap.github.io/ettercap/" target="_blank">Ettercap</a>, <code>dsniff</code>) for your analysis.  Please answer all the questions below:</p>

<h3><code>set1.pcap</code></h3>
<p>1. How many packets are there in this set?</p>
<p>2. What protocol was used to transfer files from PC to server?</p>
<p>3. Briefly describe why the protocol used to transfer the files is insecure?</p>
<p>4. What is the secure alternative to the protocol used to transfer files?</p>
<p>5. What is the IP address of the server? (be careful)</p>
<p>6. What was the username and password used to access the server?</p>
<p>7. How many files were transferred from PC to server?</p>
<p>8. What are the names of the files transferred from PC to server?</p>
<p>9. Extract all the files that were transferred from PC to server.  <span class="note">These files must be part of your submission!</p>
<h3><code>set2.pcap</code></h3>
<p>10. How many packets are there in this set?</p>
<p>11. How many plaintext username-password pairs are there in this packet set? Please <span class="stress">count</span> any anonymous or generic accounts.</p>
<p>12. For each of the plaintext username-password pair that you found, identify the protocol used, server IP, the corresponding domain name if possible (e.g., <code>google.com</code>), and port number.</p>
<p class="note">IMPORTANT NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT LOG ON TO THE WEBSITE OR SERVICE ASSOCIATED WITH THE USERNAME-PASSWORD THAT YOU FOUND!</p>
<p>13. Of all the plaintext username-password pairs that you found, how many of them are legitimate?  That is, the username-password was valid, access successfully granted?  Please <span class="stress">do not count</span> any anonymous or generic accounts.</p>
<p>14. Provide a listing of all IP addresses with corresponding hosts (hostname + domain name) that are in this PCAP set. Describe your methodology.</p>
<h3><code>set3.pcap</code></h3>
<p>15. How many plaintext username-password pairs are there in this packet set? Please <span class="stress">count</span> any anonymous or generic accounts.</p>
<p>16. For each of the plaintext username-password pair that you found, identify the protocol used, server IP, the corresponding domain name if possible (e.g., <code>google.com</code>), and port number.</p>
<p class="note">IMPORTANT NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT LOG ON TO THE WEBSITE OR SERVICE ASSOCIATED WITH THE USERNAME-PASSWORD THAT YOU FOUND!</p>
<p>17. Of all the plaintext username-password pairs that you found, how many of them are legitimate?  That is, the username-password was valid, access successfully granted?  Please <span class="stress">do not count</span> any anonymous or generic accounts.</p>
<h3>General Questions</h3>
<p>18. Briefly describe how you found the username-password pairs.</p>
<p>19. How did you verify the successful username-password pairs?</p>
<p>20. What advice would you give to the owners of the username-password pairs that you found so their account information would not be revealed "in-the-clear" in the future?</p>

<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>So where and how do you answer all the questions? This semester, we will be using <a href="https://trunk.tufts.edu/">Tufts Trunk (https://trunk.tufts.edu/)</a> for most lab submissions.</p>
<p>You may be thinking: "WHAT?!?!? YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!"</p>
<p>Yes, I am serious.  It's true!</p>
<p>Let me explain why, and there are good reasons:</p>
<ol>
	<li>For this course, using Git and GitHub is overkill.</li>
	<li>For a short answer assignment like this lab, Git and GitHub is way overkill.</li>
	<li>Each student who is officially enrolled in this course has access to Tufts Trunk.</li>
	<li>Not everyone is this class has taken Web Programming with me where Git and GitHub are integral to that course.  For students who have never used revision control before, Git is not gentle to learn.</li>
	<li>I don't want to create and maintain 90+ private GitHub repositories.  In the past, all the private repositories for this course at the end of the semester were deleted anyway.</li>
	<li>I will be teaching this course again this summer as a six-week online course.  The platform used for a Tufts online course is Trunk.</li>
</ol>
<p>Submit your answers <em>inline</em> and upload the extracted files from <code>set1.pcap</code> to Trunk. What <em>inline</em> means: write your answers in the submission box on Trunk; DO NOT upload a text file or some other document containing your short answers.  You have unlimited submissions until the due date. DO NOT UPLOAD THE PCAPS!</p>
