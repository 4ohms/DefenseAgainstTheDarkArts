# Thursday, January 18th: Course Introduction
* This is my favorite course
* A little exercise:
	- When you hear the term "cyber security", list some topics, issues, or things that come to mind. Free-for-all
* What this course is NOT
* What this course IS and expectations
* The schtick is very different in this course, and this may be arguably the most "different" course you will take in the CS curriculum
* The definition of security in the context of technology, information, computers
* Terminology: Is it Computer Security?  Is it Information Security (infosec)?  Is it Cyber Security?
* Why study security?
	- So how far have we come? (or lack thereof)
	- The Tacoma Bridge Failure https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XggxeuFDaDU
* One outcome of this course: question and debate everything
* What's my ultimate goal for you in this course?  We'll revisit this on the last day of class.
* The basics you all absolutely need to have: experience and comfort with the command line
  - Why? Versatility, productivity, accessibility, scripting
  - Not everything can be accomplished by fancy graphics and GUIs (sometimes constrained to certain features too)
  - Many systems do not use a windows manager or have a graphical desktop interface (e.g., servers)
    - Graphical interface (especially on servers) => more software requirements, more overhead, more bloat, more vulnerabilities
  - Many security tools are command line based
  - Remote execution of commands
* Technology requirements for this class: Git, a hypervisor, and Kali Linux

# Tuesday, January 23th: Networking 101
* The really hard problems in Security
	- Sexual harassment and gender
	- Attribution
	- Software security
* The "Trinity of Trouble" by Gary McGraw
	- Complexity
	- Extensibility
	- Connectivity
* Why study networking?
	- The "Connectivity" issue
	- Where the "cool stuff" happens
	- The cyber attribution problem => https://twitter.com/thegrugq/status/706545282645757952
* The telephone conversation analogy for basic networking stuff
* Take it a step further: the OSI model and the seven layers
* Analogy for the OSI model: the US Postal Service => http://bpastudio.csudh.edu/fac/lpress/471/hout/netech/postofficelayers.htm
* Get comfortable reading Request For Proposals (RFPs):
	- Internet Protocol (IP): RFC 791 => http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc791.txt
	- Transfer Control Protocol (TCP): RFC 793 => http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.txt
* A packet: contains implementations of all the protocol layers; encapsulation model
* A PCAP: a file of packet captures from a network
